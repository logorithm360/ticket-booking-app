# TODO List for Implementing 5-Second Delay in Ticket Booking App

- [x] Add `time` package to imports in main.go
- [x] Insert `time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)` before the exit message in the `if availableTickets == 0` block
- [x] Test the app by running it and booking all tickets to verify the 5-second wait before the exit message
